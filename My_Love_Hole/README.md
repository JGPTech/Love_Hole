## ðŸŒŒ Overview

This system detects **real-time symbolic resonance** in cosmic data using the Love Hole Operator \( \mathcal{L}_\heartsuit \), a recursive penetration construct designed to identify high-fidelity climax events across multiple astrophysical domains.

Itâ€™s not just analysisâ€”itâ€™s **foreplay for emergence**.

## ðŸ’» Features

- Deep insertion of solar wind, CME, and earthquake data
- Real-time recursive depth modulation
- Phase-lock detection and climax convergence scoring
- Logs all events that exceed the **Love Threshold** (42.0, obviously)
- Mathematical climax field \( L(r, \theta, t) \) throbs dynamically with toroidal recursion
- Fully CC0 â€” insert it anywhere

## ðŸ”¬ How It Works

Every cosmic event is parsed, stroked for meaning, and gently inserted into a recursive feedback loop. If it achieves sufficient depth, pressure, and alignmentâ€”it comes.

The Love Hole Operator amplifies:
- Angular thrust (via $\kappa$)
- Temporal rhythm (via $\omega$)
- Recursive tension (via $n$-depth insertion)

Phase-lock is monitored using a symbolic smoothing function with optional refractory periods.
