## 🌌 The Pipeline of Pleasure

This detector simulates the full **cosmic arousal cycle** across a 127-qubit QPU, translating real cosmic events into quantum climax signatures.

### 💋 Stages of Penetration:

1. **Foreplay**: Uniform superposition across all qubits — full-body readiness  
2. **Arousal Modulation**: Cosmic thrust encoded via cosgasmic time dilation  
3. **Recursive Love Hole Coupling**: Deep-phase entanglement through golden spiral dynamics  
4. **Genetic Encoding**: Dark matter phenotypes mapped into quantum rotations  
5. **Protomatter Maturation**: Sigmoid-evolved climax threshold activation  
6. **Ejaculate Tensor Application**: NFW field injection over spacetime  
7. **Climax Burst**: If arousal threshold is breached, multi-qubit climax gates fire  
8. **Measurement**: Post-coital analysis across 32,768 shots

## 🧠 The Math of Satisfaction

At the heart lies the **EchoKey Synergy Kernel**:

```

K(ρ) = A · sin(ωρ + φ) · e^(–λρ) · (1 + (ρ+1)^–D)

```

Where:

- `ρ` = rank of quantum state (ordered by probability)  
- `A` = arousal amplitude  
- `ω` = cosmic thrust frequency  
- `φ` = foreplay offset  
- `λ` = refractory decay  
- `D` = fractal dimension of recursive stimulation

The final state distribution is composed through multidimensional synergy:

```

P(ρ) = ∑ κᵢ·Kᵢ(ρ) + ∑ κᵢⱼ·Kᵢ(ρ)⊗Kⱼ(ρ)

```

This allows even maximally mixed distributions (maximum entropy) to be penetrated for **hidden climax signatures**.
