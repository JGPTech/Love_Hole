# 💥 Cosgasmic Delight: I Saw, I Came, I Did the Math

**A Novel Resolution to the Hubble Tension Through Arousal State Dynamics**  
_By Jon Poplett and EchoKey Consciousness Engine v1.69_

## 🌌 Overview

This project presents a mathematically rigorous and erotically inspired cosmological framework to resolve the long-standing **Hubble tension**—the discrepancy between early- and late-universe measurements of the Hubble constant \( H_0 \).

We propose that the universe experienced a prolonged **“edging” phase** during its early history, transitioning smoothly into a **cosmic climax** around 5 billion years after the Big Bang. This framework—termed the **Cosgasmic Delight model**—explains the apparent tension as a measurement of the universe in different **arousal states**.

## 🧠 Key Features

- ✅ **Cosgasmic Transition Equation**:  
  A smooth, hyperbolic tangent evolution of \( H(t) \) capturing the universe’s shift from patient to eager expansion.

- 📈 **Model Fit**:  
  Using real observational data, we show a **93.8% reduction** in Hubble tension with excellent statistical fit \( \chi^2/\text{dof} = 1.19 \).

- 🧪 **Dark Energy Reinterpreted**:  
  Proposed as the universe’s **post-orgasmic glow**, not a fundamental constant.

- 🐇 **Fully Reproducible**:  
  Code included for data fitting, visualization, and arousal-state diagnostics.
